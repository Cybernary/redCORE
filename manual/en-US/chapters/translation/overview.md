## Translation in redCORE

Joomla CMS incorporates a system to create multilingual sites. At the same time redCORE offers a alternative system for translating Joomla and Joomla Extensions.

### Joomla CMS native translation vs. redCORE translation
Comparison between the Joomla native translation system and redCORE System:
* All is translatable: unlike joomla native solution redCORE allows you to translate any item, for example plugins configuration parameters.
* Less information stored in the database: redCORE translation system allow to translate only these fields that you need to translate saving precious time and storage memory on your site.
* Extending translation: redCORE allows you to translate even these extensions witch are not ready to be translatable. Only a small XML file is needed and you are ready to internationalise.

### Compatibility with other translation systems
redCORE is ready to import translations from other system like Joomfish or Falang. This allows you to migrate old Joomla 1.5 sites to Joomla 3.x ensuring that your translated contents will still work without issues.
