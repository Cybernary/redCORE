## Webservices in redCORE

Webservices in redCORE provide a RESTfull (Representational state transfer) interface for your site.
Generating mapping XML file which will expose your webservice is very easy and you can read about them in following chapters.


### Out of the box

We have provided many webservice XML files which you can use to expose Joomla core as a standalone API.

1. `Contact` (site and administrator) - this webservice provides full access to com_contact CRUD functionality and exposes number of specific tasks


### Getting started with redCORE webservices

redCORE provides a user interface for webservice management in your administration. It also provides the overview for your webservices, getting information about each.
After installing webservice you'll also have a feature that will build automatic documentation for your webservice, enabling help to developers who will interact with it.
To keep it short, redCORE is the easiest way to build robust, secure, and documented APIs.
