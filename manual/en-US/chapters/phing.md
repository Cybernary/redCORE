## What is PHING
PHing Is Not GNU make; it's a PHP project build system or build tool based on â€‹Apache Ant. You can do anything with it that you could do with a traditional build system like GNU make, and its use of simple XML build files and extensible PHP "task" classes make it an easy-to-use and highly flexible build framework.

redCORE provides several PHING scripts to be used by the developers to automate tasks like packaging the extension.

## Packaging redCORE inside your extension
To add redCORE inside your extension we use a sub PHING script. This subscript ensures that the redCORE added to your 
extension uses the less space as possible by removing uncompressed files: JS, CSS,...

See the target "copyredcore" of the following extension PHING packager script:

```
	...	   
	<!-- The following target will call the copyredcore script that copies only the compressed files  -->
    <target name="copyredcore">
        <phing phingfile="${project.basedir}/redCORE/redcore_copy_mandatory.xml"
               target="copyframework"
               haltonfailure="true">
            <property name="redcoretargetdir" value="${targetdir}/redCORE" />
           <property name="redcorepath" value="${project.basedir}/redCORE" />
        </phing>
    </target>
 
    <!-- ============================================  -->
    <!-- (DEFAULT)  Target: dist                       -->
    <!-- ============================================  -->
 
    <target name="dist" depends="build, copyredcore">
        <echo msg="Creating ZIP archive..."/>
        <zip destfile="${temp.dir}/../${extension}-${version}.zip">
            <fileset dir="${targetdir}">
                <include name="**"/>
                <exclude name=".*"/>
            </fileset>
        </zip>
 
        <echo msg="Files copied and compressed in build directory OK!"/>
        <delete dir="${temp.dir}" />
    </target>
```
    
If you want to use the previous script for package Your Properties file look at the PHING extension packager provided at redCORE: [https://github.com/redCOMPONENT-COM/redCORE/blob/develop/extension_packager.xml](https://github.com/redCOMPONENT-COM/redCORE/blob/develop/extension_packager.xml)
